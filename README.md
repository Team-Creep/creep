| 3   | As a user, I want to easily understand the scoring system, so that they can rack up as many points as possible   |
| 4   | As a dev, I want to create a persistant database with an arbitrary scoring system, so that users can store their high scores   |
| 5   | As a dev, I want the user to land in an empty landscape, so that they can start from scratch and build new things   |


### MVP Wireframe

### Requirements
The vision of this project is to create a landscape world that allows the user to login and create and destroy blocks. These blocks can be used to build a digital world. This game allows a user to expand their creativity and kill boredom. Our first goal is to let the user expand on their creativity. Our stretch goal is to have a Survival mode that challenges the user to survive in their constructed universe (build shelter, find food, and craft tools).
