### User Stories
- As a user, I want a fun, interactive UI, so that I can kill some quarantine boredom

- As a user, I want to be able to build items to improve the overall aesthetic of myâ€¦.land?

- As a user, I want to easily understand the scoring system, so that they can rack up as many points as possible

- As a dev, I want to create a persistant database with an arbitrary scoring system, so that users can store their high scores

- As a dev, I want the user to land in an empty landscape, so that they can start from scratch and build new things
