# Creep

Team Creep: Audrena Vacrica, Nebiyu Kifle, Sian Culligan, Grace Choi   

Organization: https://github.com/Team-Creep  

## Communication Plan
Main method of communication: Slack group   
Be respectful. Give all team members the space to express their thoughts, without interruption. As a group we agree to encourage open communication where all voices are equal. We will listen intentionally, giving each voice equal weight and consideration. We will do our best not to interrupt, allowing the speaker to reach their point even if not yet fully formed. If a team member is uncomfortable, the team will make an effort to alleviate any stressors in order to create a safe and productive environment for everyone.

## Schedule
Regular hours: standard class times  
Optional outside class hours: 430pm â€“ 630pm (Monday-Saturday)  
No meetings: Sundays  
Team members should notify others if they are not available / will not be available.   

## Conflict Plan
Coding conflicts should be handled within pair programming teams first if applicable. 15-minute rule applies. Subsequently, disagreements and unresolved concerns can be brought to the group as a whole and addressed through consensus-forming. In the unlikely event of an impasse, voice vote! Other conflicts (outside of coding blockers) should be communicated open-discussion style, either in pairs or groups, and an instructor (if necessary). 

## Work Plan
Tasks will be identified through preparatory wireframing and relational diagrams used to develop the initial project concept. These tasks will be partitioned through Trello, and updated as necessary. In order to ensure that all team members have the opportunity to work on substantial components, we will evenly divide major tasks up during daily stand ups and visually flagging ownership on Trello. Nominal communication through Remo and Slack.

## Git Process
Create a team organization on Github. Backend repository with main, staging, and developmental milestone branches. Team commits to staging branch EOD. Full-team approval required for all branch commits to staging. Two-person approval for all development branch commits. Merge conflicts will be handled with empathy and love. 

## Other 
Daily standups: 6:30pm-7pm  
Breaks: 10-minute breaks every hour  
Blockers: 15-minute rule for problem-solving  
EOD meeting: recap progress and goals met (contemporary with GitHub commits).   
For individual efforts outside of designated hours, work should be done on development branches and committed at next available opportunity with a team member.
